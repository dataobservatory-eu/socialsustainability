We are a Netherlands-based start-up company that makes big data reliable and accountable, delivering trustworthy analytics and AI solutions. We validate multiple data sources and are able to merge private and proprietary data with open data. We bring novel insight into policy and business problems, as well as scientific research. Our work addresses the potentially negative effects of black-box proprietary algorithms. Our diverse team is particularly experienced in music, the creative industries, and digital humanities, where data is scattered in small organizations.

Our flagship demo projects are the [Listen Local](https://reprex.nl//project/listen-local/)  ethical music recommendation system based on our [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) data integration and knowledge sharing platform. We have validated our product/market fit in the prestigious [Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Lab](/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/). We are members of the [Dutch AI Coalition](https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-16-nlaic/) and participate in the work of the [European AI Alliance](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-ai-alliance).
