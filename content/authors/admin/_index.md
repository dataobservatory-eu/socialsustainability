Sustainability is “meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Our data observatory aims to develop indicators that help companies, organizations and policymakers track that humans, now and in the future, have what they need within the limits of the ecological constraints of our world. We aim to provide high-quality KPIs, business and policy indicators to control and monitor alignment with the [Social Economy Action Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1537&langId=en), the [European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/economy-works-people/jobs-growth-and-investment/european-pillar-social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-action-plan_en) and 
[Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/gender-equality-strategy_en) within the European Union, along with the social aspects of the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations.
